# PrimeNumberCalculator

This is a simple console application that calculates whether the number entered by a user is a prime.
If it is a prime, it will indicate prime. If it is not a prime, it will indicate the number's factors.
The program observes the single responsibility principle of SOLID by having multiple classes which are only responsible for one thing.
The program also handles simple errrors such as if the user enters a string instead of a number.
The program is looped so that the user can continue entering numbers instead of having the program break once the first input is returned.
